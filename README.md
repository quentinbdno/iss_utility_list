# iss_utility_list
Cybersecurity is a vast domain. It is really difficult for beginner to find their way. To help them start their journey or to remind older members of the community, I create a list of all ressources that can help us.
You can use freely this database.

They are presented in [https://www.datatatemplar.fr](https://datatemplar.fr/veille/). On the page, you will have the possibility to filters the results.

I hope you will make a lot of pull requests to improve this database.

# Propose an item to the list
You can propose a modification in an existing file or create a new one in order to add an item to the list. An object is represented by a YAML file. You just need to follow this template.

```yaml

You want to delete an element in the list ? You can create an issue ticket and I will delete it.
